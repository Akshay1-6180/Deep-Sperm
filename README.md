# Deep-Sperm
There have been global concerns regarding falling rates of infertitlity among men and there has been an increase of couples seeking medical assistance for reproduction.The analysis of the semen sample is usually performed by clinician who calculates the sperm concentraion , motility, morphology , volumne , appearence ,pH, viscosoty, Percentage of motile and non motile sperms and other parameters.Manual evaluation of a sample using a microscope takes a lot of time and it requires extensive traning and practise for the clinican. Morever the results obtained from the clinician have limited reproducibilty and it can have lot of variations between different clinicians. To overcome these issues we have come up with a deep learning model that can predict the concentraion of the sperm sample along with the prediction of the path and other paramters of the most viable sperms using Deep learning algorithms
