 abstract = {Objective—To investigate whether semen quality has changed during the past 50 years. Design—Review of publications on semen quality in men without a history of infertility selected by means of Cumulated Index Medicus and Current List (1930-1965) and MEDLINE Silver Platter database (1966-August 1991). Subjects—14 947 men included in a total of 61 papers published between 1938 and 1991. Main outcome measures—Mean sperm density and mean seminal volume. Results—Linear regression of data weighted by number of men in each study showed a significant decrease in mean sperm count from 113×10⁶/ml in 1940 to 66×10⁶/ml in 1990 (p<0.0001) and in seminal volume from 3.40 ml to 2.75 ml (p=0.027), indicating an even more pronounced decrease in sperm production than expressed by the decline in sperm density. Conclusions—There has been a genuine decline in semen quality over the past 50 years. As male fertility is to some extent correlated with sperm count the results may reflect an overall reduction in male fertility. The biological significance of these changes is emphasised by a concomitant increase in the incidence of genitourinary abnormalities such as testicular cancer and possibly also cryptorchidism and hypospadias, suggesting a growing impact of factors with serious effects on male gonadal function.},

The technique is based on a multimodal label-free microscopy system that simultaneously retrieves both morphological and molecular information based on quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The parameters obtained from these measurements are processed through a machine learning algorithm that makes it possible to reliably assess the macrophage activation state at single-cell level. We found that while each parameter set (morphology and Raman) can detect the activation state, they provide complementary information. Morphology is symptomatic of downstream phenotypes that make the detection dose-dependent, while Raman is indicative of upstream molecular changes that enable the detection of selective inhibition of activation pathways.We present a method enabling the noninvasive study of minute cellular changes in response to stimuli, based on the acquisition of multiple parameters through label-free microscopy. The retrieved parameters are related to different attributes of the cell. Morphological variables are extracted from quantitative phase microscopy and autofluorescence images, while molecular indicators are retrieved via Raman spectroscopy. We show that these independent parameters can be used to build a multivariate statistical model based on logistic regression, which we apply to the detection at the single-cell level of macrophage activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and compare their respective performance in assessing the individual cellular state. The models generated from either morphology or Raman can reliably and independently detect the activation state of macrophage cells, which is validated by comparison with their cytokine secretion and intracellular expression of molecules related to the immune response. The independent models agree on the degree of activation, showing that the features provide insight into the cellular response heterogeneity. We found that morphological indicators are linked to the phenotype, which is mostly related to downstream effects, making the results obtained with these variables dose-dependent. On the other hand, Raman indicators are representative of upstream intracellular molecular changes related to specific activation pathways. By partially inhibiting the LPS-induced activation using progesterone, we could identify several subpopulations, showing the ability of our approach to identify the effect of LPS activation, specific inhibition of LPS, and also the effect of progesterone alone on macrophage cells.},

abstract = {Background and Objective
Object detection is a primary research interest in computer vision. Sperm-cell detection in a densely populated bull semen microscopic observation video presents challenges that are more difficult than those presented by other general object-detection cases. These challenges include partial occlusion, vast number of objects in a single video frame, tiny size of the object, artifacts, low contrast, low video resolution, and blurry objects because of the rapid movement of the sperm cells. This study proposes a deep neural network architecture, called DeepSperm, that solves the aforementioned problems and is more accurate and faster than state-of-the-art architectures.
Methods
In the proposed architecture, we use only one detection layer, which is specific for small object detection. For handling overfitting and increasing accuracy, we set a higher input network resolution, use a dropout layer, and perform data augmentation on saturation and exposure. Several hyper-parameters are tuned to achieve better performance. Mean average precision (mAP), confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure accuracy. Frame per second (fps) is used to measure speed. We compare our proposed method with you only look once (YOLO) v3 and YOLOv4.
Results
In our experiment, we achieve 94.11 mAP on the test dataset, F1-score of 0.93, and a processing speed of 51.9 fps. In comparison with YOLOv4, our proposed method is 2.18 x faster on testing, and 2.9 x faster on training with a small dataset, while achieving comparative detection accuracy. The weights file size was also reduced significantly, with one-twentieth that of YOLOv4. Moreover, it requires a 1.07 x less graphical processing unit (GPU) memory than YOLOv4.
Conclusions
This study proposes DeepSperm, which is a simple, effective, and efficient deep neural network architecture with its hyper-parameters and configuration to detect bull sperm cells robustly in real time. In our experiments, we surpass the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, speed, and resource needs.}

abstract = {Background
Infertility is a global health concern, and couples are increasingly seeking medical assistance to achieve reproduction. Semen analysis is a primary assessment performed by a clinician, in which the morphology of the sperm population is evaluated. Machine learning algorithms that automate, standardize, and expedite sperm classification are the subject of ongoing research.
Method
We demonstrate a deep learning method to classify sperm into one of several World Health Organization (WHO) shape-based categories. Our method uses VGG16, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) initially trained on ImageNet, a collection of human-annotated everyday images, which we retrain for sperm classification using two freely-available sperm head datasets (HuSHeM and SCIAN).
Results
Our deep learning approach classifies sperm at high accuracy and performs well in head-to-head comparisons with earlier approaches using identical datasets. We demonstrate improvement in true positive rate over a classifier approach based on a cascade ensemble of support vector machines (CE-SVM) and show similar true positive rates as compared to an adaptive patch-based dictionary learning (APDL) method. Retraining an off-the-shelf VGG16 network avoids excessive neural network computation or having to learn and use the massive dictionaries required for sparse representation, both of which can be computationally expensive.
Conclusions
We show that our deep learning approach to sperm head classification represents a viable method to automate, standardize, and accelerate semen analysis. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence technologies to eventually exceed human experts in terms of accuracy, reliability, and throughput.}
